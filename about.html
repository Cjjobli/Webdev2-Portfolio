                <h2>Skills I learned this semester:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML, CSS, Javascript</li>
                    <li>C#</li>
                    <li>SQL</li>
                </ul>
                <p id="learnedDetails">  Throughout the semester I learned lots of new things such as technical skills from my programming, database, system analysis, web-dev, and networking classes to human skills in my professional development class. 
                <br>
                <br>I learned five new languages this term including HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, C#, and SQL. I also learned many things about creating and improving resumes as well as practicing my interview skills. Moreover, I delved into many different things about networking, creating object and analyses models, and lots of interesting things about databases. I thoroughly enjoyed learning new information even if some were challenging and made me want to rip my hair off.</p>
